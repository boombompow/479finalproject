        Privacy Notice for the Google TV Platform

        Last modified: October 25, 2011 (<a href="http://www.google.ca/tv/archive/privacy.html">view archived
        version</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html">Google Privacy Policy</a> describes
        how we treat personal information during your use of Google's products and services
        (â¬SGoogle Servicesâ¬ý), including Google TV. This Privacy Notice specifically describes our
        privacy practices relating to Google TV. If you have not yet updated to the version of
        Google TV first made available on October 25, 2011, you remain subject to the Privacy
        Notice for the Google TV Platform (version 1), which can be found <a href="http://www.google.ca/tv/archive/privacy.html">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        â¬SGoogle TVâ¬ý is a Google Service that is incorporated into or that works in conjunction with
        certain third-party hardware, devices, products, applications, and services that are
        provided by Googleâ¬"s partners, application developers, and/or licensees of the Google TV
        software platform. The Google TV software platform is referred to below as the "Google TV
        Platform." Hardware on which the Google TV Platform is installed is referred to below as
        the "Google TV Product." A number of products, applications, and services are available
        through and for use on the Google TV Platform. These are referred to as â¬SRetail Productsâ¬ý
        below. The Google Privacy Policy and this Privacy Notice for the Google TV Platform are
        referred to together as the â¬SGoogle Privacy Policies.â¬ý
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that products and services provided by third parties, including but not limited
        to providers of the Google TV Product and Retail Products, may be governed by separate
        privacy policies made available by those third parties (â¬SOther Privacy Policiesâ¬ý). The
        Google Privacy Policies apply only to products and services provided by Google, and not to
        those provided by third parties. In the same way, any privacy terms presented to you in
        Other Privacy Policies or other third-party agreements are controlling only with respect to
        the non-Google elements of those products. You should carefully review any Other Privacy
        Policies that apply to your use of other products and services, including Retail Products
        and Google TV Products. To the extent that any Other Privacy Policies or third-party
        agreements contain any provision bearing on your legal relationship with Google on privacy
        matters, that provision is null and void, regardless of whether it conflicts with or agrees
        with the Google Privacy Policies. Only the Google Privacy Policies apply to Google Services
        and your use of Google Services; the Google Privacy Policies override and supersede any
        provision or statement made by any other party relating to Googleâ¬"s data collection or
        privacy practices, or to your use of Google Services.

        Information we do not collect
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Google will not collect your TV viewing history unless you provide opt-in
            consent.</strong> As reviewed below, you may elect to have the Google TV Platform
            collect and store information about which content you select or tune to through the
            regular television service connected to your Google TV Product and/or the "TV and
            Movies" feature on the Google TV Platform. Otherwise, the Google TV Platform does not
            collect information about what content you watch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that third-party television service providers typically collect user data
            relating to channels tuned to and content viewed through their services (â¬STuning Dataâ¬ý)
            and may share that information with third parties under certain circumstances; please
            consult your TV serviceâ¬"s subscriber privacy policy for more information. For certain
            Google TV Products with enhanced integration with Google TV (for example, DISH
            Network's products and services), we will have the ability to receive Tuning Data from
            your television service provider. Before we receive any personalized Tuning Data that
            is related to your use of the Google TV Platform and sharable by your service provider,
            we will ask for your opt-in consent. If we do not ask for your consent to receive data
            from your television service provider, enhanced integration is not possible with your
            Google TV Product and we will neither request nor receive your Tuning Data from your
            service provider. If you have a Google TV Product that permits enhanced integration and
            you consent to sharing your Tuning Data, Google will use your Tuning Data to provide
            you with additional functionality, personalized features and/or an enhanced integration
            of your television service with the Google TV Platform. If you do not consent to your
            service provider sharing personalized Tuning Data with Google, you will still be able
            use the Google TV Platform, but it will lack the enhanced integration provided by
            sharing your Tuning Data (for example, you may not be able to search across DVR and
            Video on Demand content). We also may use such data internally to improve the Google TV
            Platform or other Google Services. To the extent that we share Tuning Data with third
            parties (such as Google TV application developers) in the future, we will do so only if
            you give your opt-in consent and if the sharing is for the purpose of providing
            enhancements and improvements to the Google Services or Google TV Products.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Google TV does not knowingly or intentionally collect information from
          individuals under the age of 13.</strong> You must be at least 13 years old to establish
          a <a href="http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=27439">Google
          Account</a> for use with the Google TV Platform. Given the shared and social nature of
          television and video viewing, we understand that children under the age of 13 may
          sometimes use the Google TV Platform and/or Google TV Products in a family setting. They
          may do so only with the involvement of a parent or legal guardian, under that personâ¬"s
          account, and subject to the Universal Google Terms of Service and the Additional Terms of
          Service for the Google TV Platform. While certain third-party content that is
          child-oriented may be accessible via the Google TV Platform, either on television or
          online, we expect that all use of the Google TV Platform and/or Google TV Products by
          children will be under the direction and supervision of a responsible adult. You can find
          more information about safety features on Google TV (including the ability to lock access
          to the Google Chrome browser and Market applications on Google TV and/or enable Safe
          Search) at the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/googletv/">Google TV Help
          Center</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Google TV Platform does not collect location information.</strong> The
          location feature of the Google Chrome browser that allows you to share your location with
          other sites on the Web is enabled in the Google Chrome browser on Google TV. This means
          that Retail Products may request information about your location from the Google TV
          Platform, and you will have the ability to give or deny consent. Note that certain sites
          and applications may not operate properly, or at all, if location detection is not
          enabled. Also, sites that automatically detect users' Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
          will be able to detect the IP address of your Google TV Platform if you access the site
          using the Chrome Browser application on your Google TV Platform. Regardless of whether
          your location is detected by any site accessed through the Google Chrome browser, the
          Google TV Platform does not store location information other than your zip code (which
          you provide as part of the set-up process).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="c1">
        Information we collect and how we use it
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>We collect information required to set up your device.</strong> In order to set
            up your Google TV Platform, you must sign in with your Google Account (if you already
            have one) or create a new, free Google Account. Your Google Account information is
            stored by Google in connection with the registration and activation of the Google TV
            Platform. For every Google TV Product that you use, you will have to associate the
            device with a Google account before we can authenticate and activate your device. It is
            not possible to log out of the Google TV Platform itself; you must remain authenticated
            with a Google Account in order to use it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each piece of hardware that comprises a Google TV Product is assigned one or more
            identification numbers, such as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address">MAC address</a>. These identification
            numbers are associated with your Google Account and one or more of them may be used to
            authenticate and activate your Google TV Product, authenticate delivery of some
            services and features on the Google TV Platform, and to allow your device to sync
            information between the Google TV Platform and other Google Services.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>You can opt in to have your Google TV Platform collect personalized viewing
            data in three ways.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Google TV is designed to give you -- if you want it -- a personalized viewing
            experience. You can opt in to have three different types of information about your
            viewing preferences and history stored by Google TV, and you can choose to stop
            collecting and/or delete that data after opting in.
          </p>First, as referenced above, you may opt in to the collection and storage of your TV
          viewing history using the Privacy &amp; Safety settings menu on your Google TV Platform.
          If you opt in, the Google TV Platform will record the Uniform Resource Identifiers
          ("URIs") of channels you viewed on your Google TV Product. URIs provide information about
          the program name, start time of the program, etc. About three hours of viewing
          information is stored at a given time, with new information overwriting old. Information
          that is not overwritten is not automatically deleted. This information is currently only
          stored on your Google TV Product. The extent of the viewing information the Google TV
          Platform collects may vary depending upon what television service provider you use.
          Google is currently developing features that will utilize this data. If Google begins
          using this information and/or uploading it to its servers, we will update this Privacy
          Notice to reflect that change. If you wish to stop having your Google TV Platform collect
          this information, you can simply remove the checkbox from that opt-in in the Settings
          menu. You can also delete this information from your Google TV Product using the "Clear
          Video History" selection on the Settings menu. Please note that this TV viewing history
          information is different from the personalized viewing history referenced below.
          <p>
            Second, the Google TV Platform's TV &amp; Movies feature provides an optional personal
            recommendation service. If you opt in through the "Personalized Recommendations" menu
            available in the TV &amp; Movies feature's settings, the star ratings you give to
            content on the Google TV Product through the TV &amp; Movies feature will be stored on
            your Google TV Product and uploaded to our servers so that the TV &amp; Movies feature
            can provide you with personalized recommendations in the future. You can delete your
            stored ratings information in the "Personalized Recommendations" menu.
          </p>
          <p>
            Third, the TV &amp; Movies feature also permits you to store a personalized viewing
            history for purposes of providing you with recommendations. If you opt in through the
            the "Personalized Recommendations" menu available in the TV &amp; Movies feature's
            settings, the Google TV Platform will collect information about content you directly
            access through the TV &amp; Movies feature and upload that information to our servers
            to provide you with personalized recommendations through the TV &amp; Movies service.
            You can delete your viewing history information and/or have the Google TV Platform stop
            collecting that history in the "Personalized Recommendations" menu.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>We log certain data.</strong> In order to continually improve our services and
            provide a better user experience, we always collect some information and statistics
            from your Google TV Product and/or the Google TV Platform. For example, we log
            information regarding problems setting up your system, issues with features of your
            system, and your use of the quick-access keys on your remote (that is, the DVR key, the
            guide key, the search key, etc.). If you opt in to report personalized crash and usage
            information via the Settings menu, we collect additional information on your usage of
            your device, including, for example, your use of the Quick Search Box and Chrome. All
            of the log information referenced above is non-personalized after approximately two
            weeks and is then stored on our <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy_faq.html#toc-terms-server-logs">server logs</a>
            only in the aggregate, if at all.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Please keep in mind</strong> that if your Google TV Product is in a location that
          is accessible to others, such as a living room or dorm room or other community setting,
          it is your responsibility to manage access to the device in that shared setting and to
          protect any personal information stored on it. As with any shared device, you may wish to
          log out of any services (including but not limited to Google Services), applications,
          and/or web sites that you have accessed through the Google TV Platform at the end of your
          session in order to prevent inadvertently sharing information with others who later
          access your Google TV Product. Certain information relating to the sites you visit on the
          internet or items that you have bookmarked are stored on the Google TV Platform, Google
          TV Products, and/or Retail Products and may be accessible or viewable by others who have
          access to the device; in some cases, this may reveal information about television
          channels you have accessed or other video content that you have requested or that has
          been delivered to you through the Google TV Platform.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>You can clear data stored on the Google TV Platform and/or Google TV Product
          through settings on the Google TV Platform.</strong> Using settings available on your
          Google TV Platform, you can clear all of the stored data on the Google TV Platform. You
          can also perform a factory reset of your Google TV Product to clear all data from your
          device. For information on clearing history stored on your Google TV Platform and/or
          Product, and for related privacy and safety settings information, please visit the
          <a href="http://www.google.com/support/googletv/">Google TV Help Center</a>.
        </li>
        <li class="c2">
          <p>
            If a Google Service you wish to access via the Google TV Platform requires you to log
            in with a Google Account, you typically will be required to log in separately -- using
            either the same or a different Google Account, as you choose -- to access the Google
            Service and/or its personalized features. Your use of other Google Services through the
            Google TV Platform is governed by the terms of service and privacy notice applicable to
            each such Google Service. Note that if you opt in to synchronizing podcast content on
            the Google TV Platform through the Podcasts application, that information may be
            associated with the Google Account assigned to your Google TV Product and stored and
            treated in a manner consistent with the Google Privacy Policies. You can manage your
            subscriptions to online podcasts through the Google TV Platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to third-party sites across the internet, you may use the Google TV
            Platform, including the Google Chrome browser on Google TV, to access certain Google
            Services such as Gmail, Google Talk, YouTube (including YouTube Leanback), Blogger, Web
            Search, Google Video, and so forth. Certain of these Google Services may allow you to
            personalize the content you receive from Google. For these services, we will store your
            preferences and the information you provide for customization in accordance with the
            Google Privacy Policy and any privacy notice that describes how Google treats your
            personal information when you use that specific service.
          </p>
          <p>
            To fulfill contractual commitments to rightsholders who provide content through
            applications on the Google TV Platform, we may use certain information (such as unique
            device identifiers, IP address, and <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy_faq.html#toc-terms-cookie">cookies</a>) to
            enforce security limits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Google uses the information that it collects and stores from the Google TV Platform for
            the purposes described in the Google Privacy Policy, including to process your requests
            and deliver Google Services to you, provide customer service functions, provide you
            with a better user experience, and report on aggregate user trends. We may share
            non-personal aggregated information collected through the Google TV Platform with our
            business partners and certain other third parties.

        Google Chrome on Google TV
      </h3>
      <p>
        Google Chrome is pre-installed as an application on your Google TV Product. Your web
        browsing and navigation on the Google TV Platform occurs through the version of Google
        Chrome that is installed on your Google TV Product. Information specific to how we treat
        personal information when you use Google Chrome generally is set forth in the <a href="../chrome/intl/en/privacy.html">Google Chrome Privacy Notice</a>, which
        also applies to your use of Google Chrome on Google TV. Specific differences between the
        information set forth in the <a href="../chrome/intl/en/privacy.html">Google Chrome Privacy Notice</a> and
        the treatment of your personal information through Google Chrome on Google TV are described
        below. For these specific items only, and only with regard to your use of Google Chrome on
        the Google TV Platform, this Google TV Privacy Notice supersedes the Google Chrome Privacy
        Notice.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            All references to â¬Syour computerâ¬ý or â¬Syour machineâ¬ý in the Google Chrome Privacy Notice
            (or in the Google Privacy Policy or any specific Privacy Notice) should be interpreted
            as â¬Syour Google TV Product," that is, the device through which you access and use the
            Google TV Service.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>Because Google Chrome is pre-installed on the Google TV Platform, statements in the
        Google Chrome Privacy Notice that pertain to downloading, installing, or updating Google
        Chrome do not apply to Google Chrome on the Google TV Platform. Any updates to Google
        Chrome on Google TV will be performed as part of regular updates to the Google TV Platform.
        Use of Google Chrome on Google TV necessarily involves the provision of registration
        information because a Google Account is required to activate and use the Google TV
        Platform. However, you can use Google Chrome on Google TV without signing in to any
        specific Google Services other than your initial registration through the Google TV
        Platform.
        </li>
        <li>Some features of Google Chrome are not available on the pre-installed version of Google
        Chrome on Google TV (such as Translate, Autofill, downloads of extensions and plug-ins,
        location and synchronization services, and the like). For any feature not available through
        the version of Google Chrome on Google TV, the information in the Google Chrome Privacy
        Notice relating to that feature does not apply to your use of Google Chrome on the Google
        TV Platform.

            For instructions on how to delete information from your browsing history as stored on
            the Google TV Platform, or for information on managing aspects of Google Chrome that
            are unique to the Google TV Platform, please access the Settings menu on your Google TV
            Platform or visit the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/googletv/">Google TV Help
            Center online</a> rather than the Google Chrome FAQ referenced in the Google Chrome
            Privacy Notice.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The pre-installed version of Google Chrome on the Google TV Platform includes <a href="http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?answer=95464&hl=en">incognito
            mode</a>, which works in the same way as incognito mode on stand-alone versions of
            Google Chrome for sites that you visit on the internet. Although incognito mode may
            appear as an option in the menu settings of your TV application on the Google TV
            Platform (and/or the incognito mode notification icon may appear on-screen during your
            television viewing sessions if you have incognito mode enabled in Google Chrome on
            Google TV), incognito mode applies only to web sites that you visit while using Google
            Chrome. Incognito mode does not impact the collection of data by other Google Services
            and/or third-party applications or services.
