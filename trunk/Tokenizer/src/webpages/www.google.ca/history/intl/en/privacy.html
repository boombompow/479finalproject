    <h2>Web History Privacy Notice</h2>
    <p>February 22, 2007
    <p>The <a href="http://www.google.ca/privacypolicy.html">Google Privacy Policy</a> describes how we treat personal information when you use Googleâ¬"s products and services, including information provided when you use Web History. In addition, the following describes our privacy practices that are specific to Web History.
    <h3>Personal information</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You need a <a href="http://www.google.ca/privacy_glossary.html#account">Google Account</a> to use Web History. Google asks for some personal information when you create a Google Account, including your email address and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access. A Google Account allows you to access many of our services that require registration.
      <li>Web History records information about the web pages you visit and your activity on Google, including your search queries, the results you click on, and the date and time of your searches in order to improve your search experience and display your web activity. Over time, the service may also use additional information about your activity on Google or other information you provide us in order to deliver a more personalized experience.
    </ul>
    <h3>Uses</h3>
    <p>Web History uses the information described above to give you a more personalized search experience. This information will be securely transmitted to Googleâ¬"s servers and stored in association with your Google Account information in order to provide the service.
    <h3>Your choices</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You can terminate your Google Account at any time as described <a href="http://www.google.ca/help/faq_accounts.html#edit">here</a>.
      <li>You can choose to stop storing your web activity in Web History either temporarily or permanently, or remove items, as described in <a href="http://www.google.ca/support/accounts/bin/topic.py?topic=14148&hl=en">Web History Help</a>.
      <li>You can delete information from Web History using the remove feature, and it will be removed from the service. However, as is common practice in the industry, and as outlined in the <a href="http://www.google.ca/privacypolicy.html">Google Privacy Policy</a>, Google maintains a separate logs system for auditing purposes and to help us improve the quality of our services for users.
    </ul>
    <h3>More information</h3>
    <p>Google adheres to the US Safe Harbor privacy principles. For more information about the Safe Harbor framework or our registration, see the <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" rel="nofollow">Department of Commerceâ¬"s web site</a>.
