        The <a href="../privacy.html">Google Privacy Policy</a> describes how we
        treat personal information when you use Google's services, including information provided
        to Google Notebook. In addition, the following describes our practices that are specific to
        Google Notebook.
      </p>
      <p class="c1">
        Personal Information
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You need a <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_faq.html#toc-terms-account">Google
        Account</a> to use Google Notebook. Google asks for some personal information when you
        create a Google Account, including your email address and a password, which is used to
        protect your account from unauthorized access. A Google Account allows you to access many
        of our services that require registration.
        </li>
        <li>We process and maintain the content you store in your notebooks in order to operate and
        improve Google Notebook and other Google services.
        </li>
        <li>If you publish a notebook, the nickname specified in your Google Profile will be
        associated with and made public with the published notebook.
        </li>
        <li>When you use Google Notebook, Google's servers automatically record certain information
        about your use of the service. Similar to other web services, Google records information
        such as account activity (including storage usage, number of log-ins), data displayed or
        clicked on (including UI elements, links); and other <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_faq.html#toc-terms-server-logs">log information</a>
        (including browser type, IP-address, date and time of access, cookie ID, and referrer URL).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="c1">
        Uses
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Content you publish in a public notebook may be read, copied, used and re-distributed
        by people you do not know. Use care when posting personal information on any site and do
        not include sensitive information, such as social security numbers, financial information
        or home addresses or phone numbers.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="c1">
        Your choices
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You may terminate your use of Google Notebook at any time by uninstalling the browser
        extension and deleting your notebooks. Please note that uninstalling the extension alone
        does not delete your notebooks. For more information on how to uninstall the extension and
        delete your notebooks, see <a href="http://www.google.ca/googlenotebook/faq.html">http://www.google.com/googlenotebook/faq.html</a>.
        </li>
        <li>You can unpublish a notebook at any time by utilizing the unpublish option provided
        within the user interface.
        </li>
        <li>You may delete content from your notebooks at any time, and the content will be deleted
        from our servers.
        </li>
      </ul>
