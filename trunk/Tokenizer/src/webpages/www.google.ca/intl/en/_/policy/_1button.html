          The <a href="../../privacy/privacy-policy.html">Google Privacy Policy</a> describes how
          we treat personal information when you use Googleâ¬"s products and services, including
          information provided when you use the Google +1 button. In addition, the following
          describes our additional privacy practices specific to your use of the +1 button.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Information we collect and how it is shared
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Google +1 button is a way for you to share information publicly with the world. The
          Google +1 button helps you and others receive personalized content from Google and our
          partners. The fact that you +1â¬"d something will be recorded by Google, along with
          information about the page you were viewing when you clicked on the +1 button. Your +1â¬"s
          may appear to others as an annotation with your profile name and photo in Google services
          (such as in search results or on your Google Profile) or elsewhere on websites and ads on
          the Internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will record information about your +1 activity in order to provide you and other users
          with a better experience on Google services.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to use the Google +1 button, you need to have a public Google Profile visible to
          the world, which at a minimum includes the name you chose for the profile. That name will
          be used across Google services and in some cases it may replace another name youâ¬"ve used
          when sharing content under your Google Account. We may display your <a href="http://profiles.google.com/">Google Profile</a> identity to people who have your email
          address or other identifying information.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Use of the collected information
        </h2>
        <p>
          In addition to the above-described uses, the information you provide to us is used
          subject to our main <a href="../../privacy/privacy-policy.html">Google Privacy
          Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may share aggregate statistics related to usersâ¬" +1 activity with the public, our
          users, and partners, such as publishers, advertisers, or connected sites. For example, we
          may tell a publisher that â¬S10% of the people who +1â¬"d this page are in Tacoma,
          Washington.â¬ý
        </p>
        <h2>
          Your choices
        </h2>
        <p>
          You may view the list of items you have +1â¬"d on the <a href="https://profiles.google.com/me/plusones">+1 tab</a> on your Profile. You can remove
          individual items from that list.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may <a href="https://profiles.google.com/+1/personalization/">opt out</a> of seeing
          +1 recommendations on third-party websites (including on ads on third-party sites) from
          people you know.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will store data (such as your recent +1â¬"s) locally in your browser. You may be able to
          access and clear this information in your browser settings.
        </p>
