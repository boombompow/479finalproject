          Googleâ¬"s mission is to organize the worldâ¬Üs information and make it universally
          accessible and useful.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Beginning in 1996, Stanford University graduate students Larry Page and Sergey Brin built
          a search engine called â¬SBackRubâ¬ý that used links to determine the importance of
          individual web pages. By 1998 they had formalized their work, creating the company you
          know today as Google.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then, Google has grown by leaps and bounds. From offering search in a single
          language we now offer dozens of products and servicesâ¬including various forms of
          advertising and web applications for all kinds of tasksâ¬in scores of languages. And
          starting from two computer science students in a university dorm room, we now have
          thousands of employees and offices around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          On these pages, you can find more information about Googleâ¬"s products and services, our
          principles, history, company culture and more. A lot has changed since the first Google
          search engine appeared. But some things havenâ¬"t changed: our dedication to our users and
          our belief in the possibilities of the Internet itself.

            Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin named the search engine they built â¬SGoogle,â¬ý a play
            on the word â¬Sgoogol,â¬ý the mathematical term for a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%221+followed+by+100+zeroes%22&hl=en">1 followed by
            100 zeros</a>. The name reflects the immense volume of information that exists, and the
            scope of Googleâ¬"s mission: to organize the worldâ¬"s information and make it universally
            accessible and useful.

          </div>
          <p>
            When you visit www.google.com or one of more than 180 other Google domains, you can
            find information in many different languages, check stock quotes and sports scores,
            find news headlines and look up the address of your local post office or grocery store.
            You can also find images, videos, maps, patents and much more. With universal search
            technology, you may see all of these items combined in one result page for your query,
            and services such as <a href="http://www.google.com/psearch?hl=en">personalized
            search</a> help you find even more information tailored to your interests. Weâ¬"re also
            working to digitize some of the worldâ¬"s information that until recently hasnâ¬"t been
            online, like <a href="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en">books</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Search is how Google began, and itâ¬"s still at the heart of what we do today. We devote
            more engineering time to search than to any other product, because search can always
            get better and faster at helping you find what you want, when you want it, where you
            want it.

            Google generates the majority of our revenue by offering advertisers measurable,
            cost-effective and highly relevant advertising. Our goal is for the ads you see on
            Google to be as useful to you as they are to the advertisersâ¬so that they can be a
            valuable form of information in their own right.
          </p>
          <p>
            We distinguish ads from search results or other content on a page by labeling them as
            â¬Ssponsored linksâ¬ý or â¬SAds by Google.â¬ý We donâ¬Üt sell ad placement in our search results,
            nor do we allow people to pay for a higher ranking there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hundreds of thousands of advertisers use <a href="https://adwords.google.com/um/StartNewLogin?service=adwords&hl=en&ltmpl=regionala&sourceid=awo&subid=ww-et-corp-jr1">
            Google AdWords</a> and our other services including mobile advertising and display
            advertising on the <a href="http://www.google.com/adwords/displaynetwork/">Google
            Display Network</a> and using our <a href="http://www.google.com/doubleclick/">DoubleClick</a> technology. Many hundreds of
            thousands of publisher partners, large and small, take advantage of tools like <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense?hl=en&sourceid=aso&subid=ww-en-et-ET211_GCorporate_AdsTab&medium=et">
            Google AdSense</a> to generate revenue from their content. To help marketers to analyze
            their campaigns so that they are more efficient and effective, we offer measurement
            tools like <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics">Google Analytics</a>.

            make it simpler for people to share information and get things done together. <a href="http://www.gmail.com/mail?hl=en">Gmail</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/render?hl=en">Google Calendar</a> and <a href="http://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a> help people communicate and collaborate more
            easily, whether planning a wedding or building a business itinerary. We designed
            <a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/index.html">Google Apps</a>, the
            business version of these tools, to be powerful enough for large enterprises (we use it
            across all of our company, in fact) but simple enough for mom-and-pop businesses too.
          </p>
          <p>
            With apps, your information is stored securely online, â¬Sin the cloud,â¬ý accessible from
            any device with a web connection. Because it lives online, itâ¬"s easy to share documents
            with a group of collaborators, and everyone can work on the same material at the same
            time, from different locations. And instead of of having to maintain your software,
            youâ¬"ll always have the latest version of the app so you can focus on your work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, we firmly believe that on the web, your data belongs to you, and that it
            should be portable: when you use Google Apps, you can export all of your mail,
            documents, photos or calendar entries whenever you like.

            We know that whenever you search the web you want it to be as fast as possible, with
            all your favorite websites at your fingertips, so we offer software like <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome?hl=en">Google Chrome</a> to help you browse the web
            quickly and easily. And because you should be able to access all of Googleâ¬"s services
            wherever you areâ¬even if you donâ¬Üt have a computer nearbyâ¬we make it easy for you to
            use your favorite Google products, like <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/mobile/maps/">Google Maps</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/mobile/mail/">Gmail</a>, right from your phone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Weâ¬"re also working to drive innovation so that more people can use better and cheaper
            mobile devices to access the Internet. With the <a href="../../../../../../Documentssupport.google.com/">Open Handset Alliance</a>, we developed <a href="http://www.android.com/">Android</a>, the worldâ¬"s first fully open platform that any
            mobile developer can use and any hardware manufacturer can install on a device.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2006, we acquired <a href="../../../../../../Documentstranslate.google.ca/">YouTube</a>, which lets billions
            of people discover, watch and share original videos as well as professional content.
            Content creators and advertisers large and small can share in revenue generated by
            their viewers and fans. Every day on YouTube, people around the globe connect, inform
            and inspire others through video.
