            Privacy Policies
          </h2>
          <p>
            All of Google's products and services, including Google Health, are governed by our
            main <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, which explains how we
            treat personal information. In addition, we've created a policy that describes privacy
            practices specific to Google Health. Check out the <a href="http://www.google.ca/intl/en-US/health/privacy.html">Google
            Health Privacy Policy</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Online health services that are integrated with Google Health must comply with our
            <a href="http://www.google.ca/intl/en-US/health/about/devpp.html">Google Health Developer Policies</a>, which establish strict
            privacy standards for how they collect, use, and share your information. It's up to you
            if you want to share your health information with any of these services.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Google Health Privacy FAQ
          </h2>
          <p>
            <strong>How does Google Health protect my privacy?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We'll never sell your health information or make it publicly accessible through
            searches on Google.com. We also won't share it with others unless you explicitly
            authorize us to do so, or in the limited circumstances described in the <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacypolicy.html#informationsharing">Google Privacy
            Policy</a> (such as when we're required to do so by law). When you first create and
            save personal health information, you're the only one who can view and edit it. These
            are some of the things you can do at any time:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Delete your data.
            </li>
            <li>Share your health information with others you choose.
            </li>
            <li>View who can access your account and what edits have been made to your information.
            </li>
            <li>Revoke access privileges.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Will others -- like my employer or my insurance company -- be able to access
            the information I store in Google Health?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            You, and only you, control access to your health information when you use Google
            Health. It's really up to you to choose who views or adds information to your Google
            Heath profile, and you can revoke access at any time. We let you view all of the
            activity on your account, so you can ensure that only the people and services you've
            granted access can view your profile or add information to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you choose to sync your Google Health account with your health care provider,
            pharmacy, or any other online health service, we'll tell you what kind of access the
            service will have to your account before you authorize it:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Write-only access: The service can add information to your profile but not view
            anything you've stored in it.
            </li>
            <li>Read/write access: The service can view your profile and add information to it.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>How does Google Health keep my health information secure?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We use software, hardware, and strict policies to keep your health information safe and
            private.
          </p>
          <p>
            The health information users store with us is protected by state-of-the-art
            technologies, including Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption, firewalls, alarms, and
            other technology we build ourselves or buy from other experts in the security industry.
            We have extensive backup systems in place to protect the integrity of this information.
            Google's servers are protected by strong physical security at our facilities, including
            pass codes, locks, and security personnel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Procedural safeguards are also in place to secure the health information users store
            with us. Within Google, only the people who are operating and improving Google Health
            have access to user information, and they are bound by strict policies to not disclose
            this information to others, either within Google or to the outside world.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Is Google Health covered by HIPAA?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike a doctor or health plan, Google Health is not regulated by the Health Insurance
            Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), a federal law that establishes data
            confidentiality standards for patient health information. This is because Google does
            not store data on behalf of health care providers. Instead, our primary relationship is
            with you, the user. Under HIPAA, you have a right to obtain a copy of your medical
            records. If you choose to use Google Health, we'll help you store and manage your
            medical records online.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although Google Health is not covered by HIPAA, we are committed to protecting your
            privacy. Our <a href="http://www.google.ca/intl/en-US/health/privacy.html">Google Health Privacy Policy</a> governs what
            information Google Health collects and how we use it, and any violation of that policy
            can be enforced by the Federal Trade Commission, which takes action against companies
            that engage in unfair and deceptive trade practices -- including violations of their
            privacy policies.

            <span class="new">New!</span> Updated Privacy and Developer Policies - September, 2010
          </h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Why are there changes to the Google Health Privacy and Developer
            Policies?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the launch of Google Health in May 2008, the healthcare industry has been very
            active and the landscape for health information technology has been evolving. Our team
            has been tracking these changes and learning from our users and business partners.
            Given new developments in the industry, we have updated our Google Health <a href="http://www.google.ca/intl/en-US/health/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="http://www.google.ca/intl/en-US/health/about/devpp.html">Developer Policies</a> to
            better protect our users, support our partners, and respond to changes in the industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What are the changes to the the Google Health Privacy Policy?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a few changes to the <a href="http://www.google.ca/intl/en-US/health/privacy.html">Google Health Privacy
            Policy</a> we would like to highlight for you.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The first change to the Google Health Privacy Policy is for our integrated partners
            (e.g., hospitals, doctors, retail pharmacies, third party applications, etc.) who are
            covered by HIPAA. These partners are already subject to existing privacy standards
            enforced by HIPAA, so with respect to these obligations, we will hold partners covered
            by HIPAA to the privacy standards enforced by HIPAA instead of those defined by the
            <a href="http://www.google.ca/intl/en-US/health/about/devpp.html">Google Health Developer Policies</a>. All other integrated
            partners, who are not HIPAA covered entities, will continue to abide by the Google
            Health Developer Policies. The Google Health Developer Policies require integrated
            partners to comply with strict privacy standards for how they collect, use, or share
            information from Google Health users. You will still have access to each partner's
            privacy policy before agreeing to share your data so you can make informed choices
            before sharing data.
            </li>
            <li>A second change to the Google Health Privacy Policy is around how we handle user
            requests to delete data from Google Health. If you request your entire personal health
            profile or account to be deleted from Google Health, we will carry out that deletion
            immediately. When you request individual data items to be deleted from your Google
            Health profile, we will continue to initiate those deletion operations right away but
            it will now take a short time (in some cases 24 hours or more) for the deleted data
            items to be completely removed from our active systems. Just as before, you will see
            that the deleted items have been immediately removed from view and access by any users
            or services. The change in time frame is around completely purging the data from Google
            Health's active systems. This change provides Google the technical flexibility to
            optimize the performance of Google Health and add future features. We do not expect
            this change to affect our users' experience with deletion.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>What are the changes to the Google Health Developer Policies?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a few changes to the <a href="http://www.google.ca/intl/en-US/health/about/devpp.html">Google Health Developer
            Policies</a> we would like to highlight for you.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The first change to the Google Health Developer Policies is that our integrated
            partners will no longer be required to provide a way to purge/delete data they have
            retrieved from your linked Google Health profile. As always, you have the choice of
            whether to link your profiles to a given service, and can choose to unlink from
            services at any time. You should review the privacy policy of the integrated partner to
            determine how the partner handles the data they have retrieved and whether they provide
            the ability to purge or delete the data, so you can make an informed choice of
            providers.
            </li>
            <li>The second change to the Google Health Developer Policies require developers to
            provide test accounts to make it easier for Google to work with partners to test and
            verify the proper functioning of their integrations and to abide by new policies within
            a specified time frame.
            </li>
            <li>The third change to the Google Health Developer Policies is that we're asking our
            partners to come into compliance with any future changes to the Google Health Developer
            Policies within 90 days of those changes.
            </li>
            <li>We've also made additional small changes in text throughout the Google Health
            Developer Policies to clarify wording and structure.
            </li>
            <li>Please note, the Google Health Developer Policies may continue to change from time
            to time. Google will post new versions of the policies if and when changes occur and
            all archived versions will be linked from the current version of the document.
