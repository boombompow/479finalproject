            The <a href="http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html">Google Privacy Policy</a> describes
            how we treat personal information when you use Google's services, including information
            provided to Google Sites. In addition, the following describes our practices that are
            specific to Google Sites.
          </p>
          <h4>
            Personal Information
          </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Account activity. You need a Google Account to use Google Sites. Google asks for
            some personal information when you create a Google Account, including your email
            address and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access.
            Google's servers automatically record certain information about your use of Google
            Sites. Similar to other web services, Google records information such as account
            activity (e.g., storage usage, number of log-ins, actions taken), data displayed or
            clicked on (e.g., UI elements, links), and other <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_faq.html#toc-terms-server-logs">log information</a> (e.g.,
            browser type, IP address, date and time of access, cookie ID, referrer URL).
            </li>
            <li>Content. Google Sites stores, processes and maintains your content in order to
            provide the service to you.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>
            Uses
          </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>We use this information internally to deliver the best possible service to you,
            such as improving the Google Sites user interface and maintaining a consistent and
            reliable user experience.
            </li>
            <li>Content you create with Google Sites may, if you choose, be read, copied, used and
            redistributed by people you know or, again if you choose, by people you do not know.
            Use care when including sensitive personal information in content you share, such as
            social security numbers, financial account information, home addresses or phone
            numbers.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>
            Your choices
          </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>You may terminate your use of Google Sites at any time.
            </li>
          </ul>
