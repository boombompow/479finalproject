          Privacy Notice
        </h2>
        <p>
          April 19, 2011
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a href="../../intl/en/privacy.html">Google Privacy Policy</a>
          describes how we treat personal information when you use Googleâ¬"s products and services,
          including information provided when you use the Google Toolbar. In addition, the
          following describes our privacy practices that are specific to the Google Toolbar. Google
          will notify you if it materially changes these policies, at which time you will have the
          opportunity to discontinue using the Google Toolbar.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Information we collect
        </h3>
        <p>
          You do not need to provide any personally identifying information in order to download
          and use the Google Toolbar. Except for Toolbar features that are specifically designed to
          work with a Google Account, all of the features can be used without sharing any
          personally identifying information. However, it is possible for data that usually
          contains no personally identifying information, such as search queries or page addresses,
          to contain such information in certain cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Google Toolbar has some basic features that work automatically any time you use the
          Toolbar. Other features are optional, and only operate and transmit data if you choose to
          enable them.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Basic Toolbar features
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Any time you use the Google Toolbar to contact Google, such as by sending a search
          query to Google, the Toolbar sends standard, limited <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy_faq.html#serverlogs">information</a> including
          your machineâ¬"s <a href="http://www.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=49209">IP address</a> and
          one or more <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy_faq.html#toc-cookies">cookies</a>. This data is
          retained in Googleâ¬"s <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy_faq.html#serverlogs">
            server logs</a> and protected according to our general Privacy Policy.
          </li>
          <li>If you navigate to a URL that does not exist, the Toolbar may send the URL to Google
          so we can help you find the URL you were looking for. If you disable the â¬SProvide
          suggestions for incorrect or unavailable URLsâ¬ý option through the Toolbar Options window,
          this information will not be sent to Google and suggestions will not be shown.
          </li>
          <li>When you type URLs or queries in the Toolbar search box, the letters you type are
          sent to Google so that the Suggest feature can automatically recommend search terms or
          URLs you may be looking for, and the Instant feature can automatically show results for
          popular searches that begin with those letters. You may disable <a href="http://www.google.com/support/toolbar/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=31954">Suggest</a>
          and <a href="http://www.google.com/support/toolbar/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1247760">Instant</a>
          though the Toolbar Options window; if you disable Suggest these letters will not be sent
          to Google, suggestions will not be shown, and the Instant feature will automatically be
          disabled. You may disable Instant while Suggest is enabled; however, the letters you type
          in the Toolbar search box will still be sent to Google unless you also disable Suggest.
          </li>
          <li>Google Toolbar includes one or more unique application numbers that are not
          associated with you or your Google Account. These numbers are sent to Google when you
          install or uninstall Google Toolbar, when the Google Toolbar periodically contacts our
          servers (for example, to request automatic updates to the software), and with Toolbar
          <a href="http://www.google.com/support/toolbar/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=32820">usage
          statistics</a> (if enabled).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          Optional Toolbar features
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Google Toolbar gives you access to other Google services and features that store data
          with Google in association with your <a href="http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=27439">Google
          Account</a>. Your use of these other services through Google Toolbar is also governed by
          those servicesâ¬" Privacy Policies.
          </li>
          <li>If you enable the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/toolbar/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=78212">Toolbar
          synchronization feature</a>, an optional feature that stores your Toolbar and browser
          setting information with Google (including <a href="http://www.google.com/support/toolbar/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=47972">AutoFill</a>
          information, if you have enabled AutoFill), this information will be stored in
          association with your Google Account.
          </li>
          <li>If you enable the optional <a href="http://www.google.com/support/toolbar/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=47972">AutoFill</a>
          feature, which automatically completes web forms for you, the Toolbar will send Google
          limited information about the structure of pages that have web forms and information such
          as the arrangement of the form so that we can improve our <a href="http://www.google.com/support/toolbar/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=47972">AutoFill</a>
          service for that page. While the information Toolbar sends may include the fact that you
          typed in the form, the actual text that you type in the fields will not be sent to Google
          unless you choose to save that data with your Account using the Toolbar Synchronization
          feature.
          </li>
          <li>If you have enabled Googleâ¬"s <a href="http://www.google.com/support/toolbar/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=78184">Web
          History</a> feature to record your web activity and are logged into Toolbar, the Toolbar
          will send the URLs of pages you visit to be stored with your Google Account. You can
          disable, pause, or remove items stored in your Web History at any time as described in
          the<a href="http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/topic.py?topic=14148&hl=en">Help
          Center</a>.
          </li>
          <li>Some older versions of Google Toolbar for Firefox include the SafeBrowsing feature.
          If this feature is enabled, the Toolbar periodically contacts Googleâ¬"s servers to
          download the most recent list of known phishing and malware sites. When you visit a site
          that we think is a phishing or malware site, the Toolbar will send Google a hashed,
          partial copy of the siteâ¬"s URL so that we can send more information about the risky URL.
          Google cannot determine the real URL you are visiting solely from this information. In
          addition, if you have chosen to share usage statistics with Google and you visit a site
          that we think could be a phishing or malware site, certain other data will be shared with
          Google, including the full URL that you visited, the â¬Srefererâ¬ý header sent to that page,
          and the URL that matched the Google Safe Browsing malware list.
          </li>
          <li>Some features may also send data to Google at the time of use. For example,
            <a href="http://www.google.com/support/toolbar/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=20871">Translate</a>
            and <a href="http://www.google.com/support/toolbar/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=32703">Spell
            check</a> work by sending the text you choose to be translated or spell-checked to
            Google, and <a href="http://www.google.com/support/toolbar/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=18188">AutoLink</a>
            works by sending Google page text (such as addresses or ISBN numbers) for which
            AutoLink information is available. If you have enhanced features enabled (as described
            below), using the Translate feature will also send the URL of the page to be translated
            back to Google.
          </li>
          <li>The My Location feature allows Toolbar to determine your approximate location based
          on your local network information, including details about nearby WiFi access points
          and/or the nearest router connected to your computer, and share that location with
          websites you choose. Websites that want to access your location must ask your permission,
          which you can grant or deny.
            <ul>
              <li>If you enable the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/toolbar/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=166104">My
              Location</a> feature by granting a website permission to access location, Toolbar
              will periodically query Google for your current location. In order to determine your
              location, Toolbar will send Google the hardware IDs (i.e., MAC addresses) and SSIDs
              of WiFi access points visible to your machine, the hardware ID (i.e., MAC address) of
              the nearest connected router, and the signal strengths of nearby access points. If
              you disable the My Location feature, this information will cease to be sent.
              </li>
              <li>The URLs or other information about websites with which you share your location
              are not sent to Google by the My Location feature. (Note: if you have also enabled
              enhanced features, as described below, the URLs may be independently sent by those
              features). You can always manage the list of websites that have access to your
              location through Toolbarâ¬"s Options menu. Third party websites with whom you choose to
              share your location information are not covered by Googleâ¬"s Privacy Policies.
              </li>

            to</a> and other features that let you transmit data from the Toolbar may log that data
            transmission, as explained in the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/toolbar/?hl=en">Help Center</a>.

        <h3>
          Enhanced Toolbar features
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Toolbarâ¬"s enhanced features, such as <a href="http://www.google.com/support/toolbar/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=79837">PageRank</a>,
          <a href="http://www.google.com/support/toolbar/bin/topic.py?hl=en&topic=24314">Sidewiki</a>,
          <a href="http://www.google.com/support/toolbar/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1306575">Related</a>,
          and the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/toolbar/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1696765">+1
          Button</a> operate by sending Google the URLs and other information about sites at the
          time you visit them.
          </li>
          <li>When you use Sidewiki to write, edit, or rate an entry, the URL of the relevant page,
          the type of action you performed and the text related to that action are sent to Google
          and stored with your Google Account. Your Sidewiki entries are publicly viewable and
          associated with your <a href="http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/topic.py?hl=en&topic=14962">Google
          profile</a>.
          </li>
          <li>When you click on the +1 Button, the fact that you +1â¬"d something will be recorded by
          Google and associated with your Google account, along with information about the page you
          were viewing when you clicked the +1 Button (such as the pageâ¬"s URL, for example). To
          read more about how Google treats information provided when you use the +1 Button, see
          the <a href="../../intl/en/_/policy/_1button.html">Google +1 Privacy
          Policy</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          Uses
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>We process your requests in order to operate and improve the Google Toolbar and other
          Google services. For example, by knowing which web page you are viewing, the PageRank
          feature of Google Toolbar can show you Googleâ¬"s ranking of that web page. And the
          Sidewiki feature can tell you if others have written Sidewiki entries on a given page.
          Likewise, by processing the text on a web page, SpellCheck can offer spelling suggestions
          and AutoLink can provide useful links to information.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          Information security
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>If you provide credit card information to use Toolbarâ¬"s AutoFill feature, that
          information will be saved on your computer in encrypted form. It is not transmitted to
          Google.
          </li>
          <li>Any information sent to Google will be maintained in accordance with the <a href="../../intl/en/privacy.html">Google Privacy Policy</a>. Googleâ¬"s Privacy
          Policy does not cover information that you send to third party sites.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          Your choices
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Any Toolbar feature that works by automatically sending Google URLs or other
          information about sites when you visit them, or that associates data with your Google
          Account, can be disabled or re-enabled as explained in the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/toolbar/?hl=en">Help Center</a> or simply not used.
          </li>
          <li>You may edit or delete a Sidewiki entry you have written at any time. If you delete a
          Sidewiki entry, it will be removed from public view but backup copies may remain on
          Googleâ¬"s servers for a limited time.
          </li>
          <li>You may view the list of items you have +1â¬"d on the +1 tab on your Google profile
          (<a href="https://profiles.google.com">https://profiles.google.com</a>). You can remove
          individual items from that list.
          </li>
          <li>If you do not wish for the Toolbar to send usage and configuration statistics as part
          of its periodic requests, you can disable usage statistics following <a href="http://www.google.com/support/toolbar/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=32820">these
          instructions</a>.
          </li>
          <li>Toolbar allows you to install third-party custom buttons and gadgets. You should
          review a third-partyâ¬"s privacy policy before installing a custom button or gadget.
          </li>
        </ul>
