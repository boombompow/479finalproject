              <p> 
                <em><strong>What Is Covered by This Section?</strong></em> The paragraphs in this section describe how we use and disseminate information collected about Public Website Visitors through our Public Website, which includes the portions of our website that are publicly available without a password. It does not cover any other data processing activities. </p>
              <p><strong><em>Your Use of the Public Website Implies Consent.</em></strong> Your use of
                the Public Website signifies your acceptance of this Privacy
                Statement. If you do not agree or are not comfortable with any
                policy described in this Privacy Statement, your remedies are
                to discontinue your use of the Public Website or to follow the
                other instructions described elsewhere in this Privacy Statement. </p>
              <p><strong><em>If You Don't Volunteer Any Personal Data, We Won't
                  Collect Any Through the Public Website.</em></strong> We use cookies and various traffic
                tracking technologies to monitor the use of our Public Website.
                We collect such data related to IP addresses but do not link
                it to any personally identifiable information (such as names
                and email addresses) that you may voluntarily submit to us through
                other means (except as described below, in &quot;Agents and
                Service Providers&quot;). </p>
              <p><strong><em>Agents and Service Providers.</em></strong> We may engage data processing agents and service providers that assist us in the processing of personally identifiable information that Public Website Visitors may volunteer through the Public Website, as well as electronic messages and traffic data that is linked to IP addresses. Such third parties process data only on our behalf and are contractually obligated to refrain from using such data for their own purposes. Each time visitors visit our Public Website after they have submitted a Web Form to us or clicked on a particular link in a marketing email from us, we maintain a record of certain information about their visit including the pages viewed on our Public Website, the time of the visit, the order of pages accessed and the amount of time such visitors spend at each page. We use this information to better tailor our services to our visitors. </p>
              <p><strong><em>Use of Cookies. </em></strong>A cookie is a small text file containing information that a web browser transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. On the Public Website, we may use cookies to analyze our site traffic patterns, but, except as described above, we link cookies only to IP addresses and not any personally identifiable information about Public Website Visitors (such as names or email addresses). For example, we currently use Google Analytics to analyze traffic to the Public Website. Other than as mentioned above, the software used by us does not have a database of individual profiles for each visitor connected to personally identifiable information. This third party software uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information, and links cookies only to IP addresses and aggregate data about the traffic to the Public Website. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. Please consult your browser's manual or online help if you want information on restricting or disabling the browser's handling of cookies. If you disable cookies, you can still view the Public Website, but some features may not be available and you may not be able to take advantage of offers or activities regarding online registration, which includes online sales.</p>
              <p><strong><em>Volunteered Information Collected on the Public Website.</em></strong> Public Website Visitors may contact us in a variety of ways, including, without limitation, by completing the Web Forms described in the table below. Contact information, such as name, address, email addresses and/or phone number, is typically provided when using these methods. This information is used to provide the services that are requested by the Public Website Visitor (e.g. to respond to your request for further information about us or our services, to send you a newsletter or White Paper if you request them, etc.). To update, correct or remove his or her contact information (for example, to unsubscribe), please send an email to <a href="mailto:privacyrequest@postini.com">privacyrequest@postini.com</a> or follow instructions provided in our newsletters. </p>
              <p> Public Website Visitors may sign up to receive various information
                or services from us, including the following: (i) free trials
                of our services, (ii) our Newsletter, (iii) White Papers, (iv)
                product demonstrations, (v) our Webinars or those of other third
                parties. Each of these submissions will produce an automated
                email response to the email address entered into the form. We
                may send promotional emails to Public Website Visitors who have
                sent us such Web Forms, although we do not currently do so for
                newsletter subscribers. If you consent to it, we may provide
                your information from these Web Forms to certain of our authorized
                resellers to communicate information to you about our services.
                If thereafter you prefer us not to provide this information
                to our authorized resellers, you may let us know by following
              the instructions described in this policy.</p>
              <p>We also allow Public Website Visitors to contact us by email with questions, comments or requests. The information collected from these emails is used to reply to such questions, comments, or requests. Sometimes we file visitor's comments, so that we can improve the Public Website in the future. A small sample of visitors to the Public Website who contact us may be invited to participate in usability studies.</p>
              <p><strong><em>Disclosure to Third Parties.</em></strong> In the course of our normal business
                activities, we do not share personally identifiable data about
                Public Website Visitors with any independent third parties,
                other than with our agents, service providers and authorized
                resellers as described in the preceding paragraphs &quot;Agents
                and Service Providers&quot; and &quot;Volunteered Information
                Collected on the Public Website.&quot; In particular, we are
                not in the business of selling, renting or loaning personally
                identifiable information to independent third parties. </p>
              <p>Nevertheless, we may have to disclose information to third parties when required by law or under the good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in order to conform to applicable law, comply with legal process served on us, or to protect the property or interests, its agents and employees, or the personal safety of others, or the public. Under such circumstances, we may be prohibited by law, court order or other legal process from providing notice of the disclosure, and we reserve the right to not provide such notice in its sole discretion. </p>
              <p>If we become involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of our assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. </p>
              <p><strong><em>Links to Other Sites. </em></strong>The Public Website may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any sites other than its own. This section on &quot;Public Website Privacy&quot; applies only to information collected by us on the Public Website. We may use service providers to collect certain information about those users who register for our webinars including the user's name, title, company name, physical address, email address, phone and fascimile number, web address, job title, company size, and job function. Our service providers then provide us this information so that we may follow-up to provide our services to such users. </p>

              <P><strong><em>What Is Covered by This Section?</em></strong> The paragraphs in this section provide information on how we use and disseminates information collected about End Users of our services through password-protected portions of our website, such as the Postini Support Portal, the Administration Console and the Message Center. It does not cover any other data processing activities. In the password-protected portions of our website, we observe the following privacy practices: 
              <p><strong><em>Personal Information About End Users is Supplied to
                  us by their Email Service Providers.</em></strong> We do not require End Users to provide personal contact or demographic information. The only information we obtain about an End User is the End User's email address and the End User's configuration settings, as well as certain information in electronic messages (such as email messages or instant messages) that are or may be linked to End Users (collectively, &quot;End User-specific information&quot;). Information about an End User's email address is provided to us as a result of our customer relationship with the End User's email service provider. This information, as well as all the other data that we obtain about End Users, is controlled by the email service provider, not by us. As such, if an End User wishes to correct or update his or her email address, the End User must contact his or her email service provider directly. </p>
              <p><strong><em>End User Control of Configuration Settings.</em></strong> If you are an End User of our services, and you wish to access your Message Center Account or adjust the application of the electronic message filtering solution to your account, you should follow the instructions provided by your email service provider. In addition, if you need to update or change the email address or other data that we may maintain about you, you should contact your email service provider for such changes. In turn, the email service provider will generally update the information that it provides to us for purposes of delivering the electronic message filtering services. </p>
              <p><strong><em>Passwords and Message Content.</em></strong> To log in to the Message Center for the first time, an End User must use the password provided by us, which is automatically generated. This password is not released to any party other than authorized personnel of the End User's email service provider, except as described herein. After the End User logs in for the first time, the End User will be prompted to enter a personalized, secret password. This password is not released to any other party. End User configuration settings and electronic messages are processed automatically by our software, and humans do not review this information except as required by law or with the consent of the End User's email service provider. All End User-specific information, and electronic message information, including content, addresses, categorizations, and IP addresses, is kept confidential. We deliver our services in compliance with the existing service agreement between us and the End User's email service provider (and End Users derive no legal rights from such agreements). </p>

                <strong>Contact Update.</strong> Our customers designate administrators with respect to our service. These designated administrators may review and edit the contact information for their company directly by using the Contact Update feature, which is available in the <a href="http://www.google.ca/support/support_login.php">Postini Support Portal</a>. </p>
              <p><strong><em>Email Communications.</em></strong> For End Users with direct access to the quarantine area of the Message Center, we will provide email notification when emails with viruses and other email are quarantined in the Message Center on a schedule that may be determined by the End User or his or her email service provider. Generally an End User may not opt-out of these types of emails as they are necessary to provide the requested service and are not promotional in nature. </p>
              <p><strong><em>Use of Cookies.</em></strong> <em><strong></strong></em> We use cookies to store the name, email addresses, and configuration settings of End Users for session management. Other than name, email address and configuration settings, these cookies do NOT hold any personal information. </p>
              <p><strong><em>Framed Environments. </em></strong>If an End User's email service provider displays the Message Center in a &quot;framed&quot; environment, we cannot guarantee the privacy practices of that email service provider. In this case, the End User must contact his or her email service provider directly to obtain information about the privacy policies of his or her email service provider.</p>
              <p><strong><em>For Additional Information, Please Contact Your Email Service
              Provider. </em></strong></p>
