        <![CDATA[On December 6, 1989 the dreams of 14 young women came to a tragic end - but their spirit remains alive today empowering other Canadian women to become engineers. Today, Concordia's Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science joins in the spirit of remembrance by supporting the Canadian Engineering Memorial Foundation (CEMF) in its efforts to support female engineers across the country.<br /><br />The CEMF was formed in 1990 by the late Claudette MacKay-Lassonde, P.Eng. and several of her colleagues in reaction to the tragedy at École Polytechnique.&nbsp; Together, they were determined to support the future of women in engineering across Canada. <br /><br />That legacy continues with over 100 Canadian women having received a CEMF scholarship in engineering to help them pursue their dreams. Each scholarship winner gives at least one presentation about why engineering is a great career option for women, and men, to a high school level audience. That means due to the leadership and support of prominent engineers in Canada, both past and present, over 10,000 students across Canada have heard a presentation on engineering since CEMF's inception.<br /><br />CEMF scholarship recipients are selected based on their strong leadership skills, ability to inspire others, volunteerism, extracurricular activities and to serve as role models. Through the support of the Foundation's individual donors, corporate and faculty partners, there will be 10 scholarships totaling $80,000 at the undergraduate, Master's and PhD levels of study offered to women in engineering for 2012. Deadline for applications for the 2012 CEMF Scholarships is Midnight, Friday, January 13, 2012.&nbsp; All scholarship criteria can be found at <a href="http://www.cemf.ca/">www.cemf.ca</a>.<br /><br />For more information on the CEMF, its scholarships and programs, please visit <a href="http://www.cemf.ca/">www.cemf.ca</a> or contact CEMF directly at 1-866-883-2363, info@cemf.ca.<br /><br /> ]]>

        <![CDATA[On December 5, Professor Emeritus Hugh McQueen launched a new book entitled<i> Hot Deformation and Processing of Aluminum Alloy</i>s. The book, published by CRC Press (part of the Taylor &amp; Francis Group), is an advanced treatise on the microstructures and strengths developed in solid aluminum alloys at temperatures of 200-550°C when being shaped into household, architectural, automotive or aerospace products. <br /><br /><object height="300" width="400"> <param name="flashvars" value="offsite=true&amp;lang=en-us&amp;page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fencs-concordia%2Fsets%2F72157628308034481%2Fshow%2F&amp;page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fencs-concordia%2Fsets%2F72157628308034481%2F&amp;set_id=72157628308034481&amp;jump_to=" /> <param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=109615" /> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=109615" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="offsite=true&amp;lang=en-us&amp;page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fencs-concordia%2Fsets%2F72157628308034481%2Fshow%2F&amp;page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fencs-concordia%2Fsets%2F72157628308034481%2F&amp;set_id=72157628308034481&amp;jump_to=" height="300" width="400"></object><br /><br />Faculty, friends, family, staff, and alumni joined Professor McQueen for shortbread and beverages in the Scottish tradition for the early evening event. Concordia's President, Fred Lowy, also came by to congratulate McQueen on the accomplishment.<br /><br />The book is based on the research of Professor McQueen, with colleagues and students over a period of 50 years, with suitable comparison to published literature. He is much relieved and delighted by its appearance since it was started when he was named a distinguished professor emeritus in 1998. He is grateful to his co-authors (two from the technical university in Ancona, Italy and one from the University of Southern California, LA) not only for their contributions of five chapters but also for their encouragement, guidance and energy. The essential contributions of many others are described in the acknowledgements.<br /><br />For more information on Professor McQueen's book, please download the following PDF document: <a href="http://www.encs.concordia.ca/documents/McQueen-Alloys.pdf">http://www.encs.concordia.ca/documents/McQueen-Alloys.pdf</a><br /> ]]>

The accesgenie.ca portal marks the first stage in their collaboration. The site proposes quick access through a single outlet to a list of courses in an array of sectors of activity specifically related to engineering. Other services relevant to engineers' needs in their professional activities will be offered in the coming months.<br /><br />The new partnership has been established to satisfy needs stemming from the new regulation on the professional development of engineers, which compels members of the Ordre des ingénieurs du Québec to accumulate at least 30 hours of professional development during a two-year reference period.<br /><br />Engineers and technologists will thus be able to quickly access the foremost expertise of three major faculties of engineering in Québec and Canada through <a href="http://accesgenie.ca/">accesgenie.ca.</a> <div><br /></div>]]>

        <![CDATA[The industrial application of academic research is a hallmark of Concordia's Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science. This fact was recently recognized during the 21st annual gala of the Association de la recherche industrielle du Québec (ADRIQ), when the technological partnership prize was jointly presented to Concordia University and Ericsson in honour of Dr. Ferhat Khendek's groundbreaking work with the telecommunications giant.<br /><br /><div align="center"><img alt="Khendek-1.jpg" src="http://newsfeed.encs.concordia.ca/encs_test/Khendek-1.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" height="330" width="440" /><font style="font-size: 0.8em;"><i>Ferhat Khendek, centre, alongside other winners during the ADRIQ gala</i></font><br /></div><br />The partnership between Ericsson and Khendek, who is a Professor within Concordia's <a href="http://www.ece.concordia.ca/">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a>, was a three-year collaboration known as pure <a href="http://users.encs.concordia.ca/%7Emagic/">MAGIC</a> - that is, the Modeling and Automatic Generation of Information and upgrade Campaigns project. Jointly funded by Ericsson and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), the project examined standardization solutions for the programs that run between a cellular device's operating systems and its applications software, also known as "middleware." <br /><br />Explains Khendek, "companies like Siemens, Nokia, Ericsson, IBM, Microsoft and HP got together to standardize these systems and thereby promote the increased usability of applications developed for them and their customers." In short, a standardized middleware means that applications can be run on a wider variety of devices. For example, says, Khendek, "if I develop an app, and both Ericsson and Nokia are running the same middleware, the app will work on devices made by both companies." <br /><br /><div align="center"><img alt="Khendek-2.jpg" src="http://newsfeed.encs.concordia.ca/encs_test/Khendek-2.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" height="256" width="440" /><i><font style="font-size: 0.8em;">Ferhat Khendek speaks onstage during the gala</font></i><br /></div><br />Khendek and his team helped Ericsson configure these applications properly and automatically, and speed up their time to market. The second aspect of the MAGIC project focused on the upgrade of such applications and how best to upgrade them with minimal downtime to the service. <br /><br />The Prix partenariat (partnership prize) is presented jointly to a company and an institution that are collaborating in a technological partnership that clearly demonstrates the benefits of shared expertise. The partnership results in the creation of a new product/procedure/technology, or research and development program, brought to term by the institution for the company, which then successfully ensures the project's commercialization. The MAGIC project undertaken by Khendek and his colleagues, both at Concordia and Ericsson, amply met these requirements and more, beating out competitors including Innu-Science Canada &amp; CNETE &amp; IDE, Trois-Rivières, Pfizer Canada &amp; Université de Sherbrooke. <br /><br />The prize was presented during the 21st ADRIQ gala, held in Montreal on November 23, 2011.]]>

Not only is Hervé the President of <a href="http://www.mechtronix.com/">Mechtronix</a> Systems Inc., he is a Concordia alumnus who received his Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering. It was especially fitting, then, that he was introduced by Dr. Martin Pugh, Chair of the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering. Taking the podium in full academic dress, Pugh praised Hervé for his business acumen and proudly told the audience that this was a man who "believes in thinking beyond traditional boundaries."<br /><br /><div align="center"><img alt="Convo-2-sm.jpg" src="http://newsfeed.encs.concordia.ca/encs_test/Convo-2-sm.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" width="440" height="285" /><font style="font-size: 0.8em;"><i>From left to right: Martin Pugh, Xavier-Henri Hervé, Robin Drew</i></font><br /></div><br />When it was Hervé's turn at the mic, he could not contain his enthusiasm, exclaiming a heartfelt "wow!" as he looked at the audience. He spoke of how the day's graduands now have the "Concordia DNA" and have been "trained to change the world through innovation." He also outlined four important elements of achievement that would help take these bright young minds to the next level: perseverance, international scope, leadership awareness, and alignment of emotions. Wrapping up his speech, he sincerely told the graduates in front of him that he was one of them now: "I'm part of your team now--give me a call if ever you need a hand!"<br /><br /><div align="center"><img alt="Convo-3-sm.jpg" src="http://newsfeed.encs.concordia.ca/encs_test/Convo-3-sm.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" width="440" height="292" /><font style="font-size: 0.8em;"><i>Concordia's Chancellor, L.

        <![CDATA[<img alt="Mehdipour.jpg" src="http://newsfeed.encs.concordia.ca/encs_test/Mehdipour.jpg" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" height="224" width="325" />Graduate student Aidin Mehdipour, from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, will receive the Governor General's Academic Gold Medal at Concordia's convocation ceremonies on November 22. He recently completed his PhD thesis entitled, Advanced Carbon-Fiber Composite Materials for Shielding and Antenna Applications, under the supervision of C.W. Trueman and A.R. Sebak.<br /><br />The Governor General's Academic Gold Medal recognizes Mehdipour's significant research accomplishments. Gold medals are awarded to graduate students in two key areas outlined in the university's Strategic Research Plan: The Person and Society (awarded during spring convocation); and Technology, Industry and the Environment (awarded during fall convocation).<br /><br />Mehdipour's thesis "is one of the most significant and comprehensive research works ever done on electromagnetic characteristics of composite materials, which is very important for avionic and spacecraft industries," says Suong Van Hoa, director of the Concordia Centre for Composites.<br /><br />Mehdipour began his research investigating the electromagnetic properties of carbon composite compared to aluminum as a shield against electromagnetic radiation on modern aircraft. Carbon composite is used instead of aluminum because it is lighter and stronger. His research was part of a joint project between Concordia, École Polytechnique de Montréal and Bell Helicopter, and funded in part by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.<br /><br />"After doing this project, I decided to try using composite materials for antenna microwave applications, because I saw there was potential there," says Mehdipour. "It was a very new area, untouched."<br /><br />Antennas made with composite materials can function in climates where metal is unsuitable. "The composite material shows very good corrosion resistance," he says. "Many people call them green antennas. Because of their resistance to corrosion and fantastic mechanical characteristics, it could be used in harsh environments, for military applications or any application outdoors."<br /><br />Mehdipour praises Concordia and his professors for supporting his research. "My supervisors supported me very well," he says. "They spent a lot of time reviewing my work, and whenever I needed some components we didn't have, they purchased them. In microwave research, the components are expensive!"<br /><br />Although Mehdipour has now graduated from Concordia, he continues to work on several projects, and recently submitted a patent application. "I still have many projects that I'm working on in my free time, specifically the patent issue, it's not a short-term project," he says. ]]>

The deal was simple: if the student group managed to raise $1,000 in support of research into funding the cure for women's cancers, Dr. Pugh would shave his head. In early November, much to Dr. Pugh's surprise, they met that goal.<br /><br /><div align="center"><img alt="2.jpg" src="http://newsfeed.encs.concordia.ca/encs_test/2.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" height="292" width="440" /><font style="font-size: 0.8em;"><i>Dr. Pugh on stage with members of WIE Concordia</i></font><br /></div><br />Always a good sport, Dr. Pugh honoured his promise and on a dark November night, went off to Reggie's with a courageous heart and generous spirit. An enthusiastic group of students, staff, and faculty members had assembled at the undergraduate student bar to cheer him on. <br /><br /><div align="center"><img alt="3.jpg" src="http://newsfeed.encs.concordia.ca/encs_test/3.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" height="292" width="440" /><font style="font-size: 0.8em;"><i>Dr. Pugh gets a close shave</i><br /></font></div><br />Dr. Pugh took to the stage without a backwards glance and stepped up to the shears, receiving a very close-cropped 'do in a matter of minutes. When it was all over, all were pleased with the aerodynamic results, and more pleased still at the impressive amounts that were raised in support of this important cause.<br /><br /><div align="center"><img alt="4.jpg" src="http://newsfeed.encs.concordia.ca/encs_test/4.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" height="292" width="440" /><font style="font-size: 0.8em;"><i>Dr. Pugh gets used to the new 'do</i></font><br /></div><br />Women in Engineering will be continuing to fundraise throughout the year.
