      <p>Here are some examples of non-legitimate excuses:</p>
      <h4> I accidentally sent the wrong file to the professor.</h4>
      <p>This seems to be a big problem with assignments being submitted electronically. You are responsible for ensuring that you are sending the correct file. Before you click on &quot;send&quot;, open the file to make sure you are sending the right document, and be very sure that you are not sending someone else's work with your name on it!</p>
      <h4>I don't know what plagiarism means.</h4>
      <p>This excuse is going to be more difficult to use as more and more information about plagiarism is made available to students. Professors are being careful to include information in their course outlines. Concordia Student Union, Advocacy and Support Services, Counselling and Development and Concordia Library provide detailed information. Information and warnings are given by professors, advisors, counsellors at every opportunity.</p>
      <h4>I come from another country and we do assignments differently there.</h4>
      <p>This is recognized as a legitimate problem, but not a legitimate excuse. Refer to the comments in the point above. Advocacy and Support Services have been offering workshops in collaboration with the International Students Office on a regular basis to inform international students.</p>
      <h4>I don't read my course outlines.</h4>
      <p>This is your responsibility.</p>
      <h4>I was sick the day the professor talked about plagiarism.</h4>
      <p> This is your responsibility.</p>
      <h4>My professor is very mean. He/she will deduct marks if assignments are late.</h4>
      <p>If you have a number of assignments and papers due at the same time and you know you will have difficulty handing them in, speak with your professors. You may be able to get an extension on some assignments, but don't wait until the deadline date. If you do, you may not receive a positive response. If your assignment will be late, it is better to lose a mark or two or even ten on the assignment than to put your reputation at risk and receive a severe penalty. And if your professor is indeed very mean and gives you a &quot;0&quot; on the assignment, your grade may be lower, but your integrity will be intact. Remember, if a charge is upheld, there will be a permanent notation on your student record. Also, if you are having difficulty managing your time, if you are taking too many courses or you can't juggle work/school commitments, seek help before you are tempted to cheat.</p>
      <h4>I accidentally copied the answer from my friend's exam.</h4>
      <p>This is really not a legitimate excuse!</p>
      <h4>My friend showed me his answer to that exam question - I didn't ask for it.</h4>
      <p>You are both in trouble!</p>
      <h4>Those are not cheat sheets (for an exam), they are study notes.</h4>
      <p>Professors and invigilators do not allow students to study during an exam.</p>
      <img src="http://provost.concordia.ca/academicintegrity/images/classroom.jpg" alt="Students and teacher in a classroom" width="280" height="167" class="framed floatright" />
	  <h4>It is the professor's fault. She didn't have to read that book (or article, or website).</h4>
      <p> Professors have every right to check sources, and to verify that a paper has or has not been plagiarized. Similarly, the University has the right to verify medical notes and other submitted documents.</p>
      <h4>I had been ill/There was a death in my family/I was going through a divorce/My children were in trouble in school/I was evicted from my apartment...</h4>
      <p>These are examples of legitimate reasons for asking for extensions on assignments or other special considerations by your professors. These are not excuses for cheating.</p>
      <h4>My mother/father/sibling/cousin/girlfriend/boyfriend was visiting and I had to look after them and take them shopping/golfing/to the theatre, etc.</h4>
      <p>This is really not a legitimate excuse!</p>
      <h4>I asked my friend to hand in the assignment and he handed in the wrong thing.</h4>
      <p>You are responsible for your own work at all times.</p>
      <h4>But it is only worth a few marks! </h4>
      <p>If an academic offense has been committed it will be dealt with harshly. You have a number of choices: doing the best you can on the assignment, handing nothing in because you didn't have time to complete it, speaking with your professor.</p>
      <h4>I have done this before and have not been caught.</h4>
      <p>If this is the case, you have been lucky.</p>
      <h4>Lots of people cheat!</h4>
      <p> This is precisely why Concordia University and other universities are taking a hard line on this issue. The integrity of the University is at stake. What value is a degree if it is obtained by dishonest means?</p>
