<h3 class="first">Michael Barkey<br />
BA Honours Linguistics, 2007</h3>

<p>Michael has completed his BA in Linguistics (Honours with Distinction) in 2007. Read Michael's testimonial: "A healthy spirit of inquiry is the most acquisition from my years at Concordia.  All of the professors in the Linguistics department promoted the importance of the investigation itself and I found mentors in them all.  There was a quality to my education that I don't think is widely available.  Working with Professor Charles Reiss and other students on the Concordia Linguistics Outreach project in my final years was formative.  Together we employed Linguistics to ease the minds of worried parents, fight racism, and help communicate mathematical principles to maximum-security prisoners who were trying to complete high school.  Another project that occupied my time was the People's Potato http://peoplespotato.blogspot.com/, which is a not-for-profit food service organization preparing and distributing daily vegan meals to approximately 400 students at Concordia University. This was an initiative that attempted to address the very serious issues of student poverty and the lack of healthy food in general.  We saw a problem and we worked towards a solution.  My ability to problem-solve in my daily life was strengthened by my education in Linguistics." </p>

<p>Enrique has completed his BA in Spanish (Honours with Great Distinction) in 2003. Read Enrique's testimonial here: "Since I remember, languages and literature were my passion. This explains why, once I have established myself in Canada, I decided to pursue studies in Spanish. Happily, I chose Concordia University to get my BA My Concordia education was a challenging and very positive experience. The Spanish faculty members supported and encouraged me in all my academic pursuits. The constant flow of ideas, the deep commitment of both students and professors to learning and research, and the friendly atmosphere were some of the many positive aspects I found at the CMLL Department. Furthermore, the excellent formation I received at Concordia University allowed me to pursue graduate studies, being able to obtain a MA degree in Spanish Linguistics in the United States. Nowadays, things have come full circle and I am proudly a member of the Part Time Faculty of the Spanish program at Concordia." </p>

Read Ximena's testimonial: "I would like to take this opportunity to thank Professor Goretti Ramírez from Concordia's Spanish Department", she says.  "I am very fortunate to have had her as my professor and Honours thesis supervisor.  Her classes prepared me well for my graduate work, and her one-on-one supervision has helped me develop a research project which I am passionate about, and continue to pursue in my graduate studies."</p>

<p>Nathalie has completed her BA in German (Honours with Great Distinction) in 2003. She was awarded the Birks Medal as the highest ranking student graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree and the Modern Languages and Linguistics Plaque as the most outstanding graduating student of all Modern Languages and Linguistics programs. Read Nathalie's testimonial:  "I had worked all day. I was a sales rep in the food business, selling dead fish in a can. That evening, I sat in a classroom of the Hall Building. An angel could have told me at that precise moment: &laquo; You are about to be born again. &raquo; I was about to meet Professor Helmut Famira. I shed my sales rep skin. I wanted to be a teacher, just like him. I finished my BA then went to McGill for a Master's and a Ph.D. I never forgot Concordia. And once in a while, in my own classroom at Bishop's, where I now teach German, its language and literature, I quote Professor Helmut Famira and smile. "</p>

<h3>Mary   Oviedo<br />
BA Honours Spanish (Literature & Society), 2010</h3>

<p>Prior to entering her BA in Spanish - Literature & Society (Honours) in 2007, Mary worked as an advertising copywriter and editor for more than ten years after graduating as a publicist from Universidad Jorge Tadeo Lozano in Bogotá, Colombia.  During her undergraduate studies she worked as a Research Assistant for Professor Catherine Vallejo and Professor Roberto Viereck-Salinas.  The education at the Classics, Modern Languages and Linguistics Department has opened the opportunity for her to be involved in the academic world of Hispanic Studies and to achieve her dream of becoming a Spanish teacher in the future. She was on the Dean's List from 2007 to 2010 and was also the recipient of the George Hanna and Norman Hébert Jr. Concordia Golf Classic Bursary during the 2009 - 2010 academic year.  After graduating with Great Distinction from Concordia University in 2010, Mary enrolled in the M.A. in Hispanic Studies at Concordia University. Her interests include 20th century Latin American literature and its intersections with politics, culture, media, and history especially in her native country of Columbia.</p>

BA Honours Classics (Classical Civilization), 2010</h3>

<p>Allison has completed her BA in Classics - Classical Civilization (Honours with Distinction) in 2010. She was also a 2010 recipient of the Classics Book Prize awarded by the Faculty of Arts & Science in recognition of her outstanding performance during her undergraduate studies in Classics.  Read Allison's testimonial: "Being a part of the CMLL department has been an invaluable experience. Not only was I able to complete my BA in Classics - Classical Civilization (Honours) but I was able to work as a Teaching Assistant for two consecutive semesters and a Research Assistant for a duration of eight months.  Working as a TA and RA gave me clear understanding of what kind of information my professors were trying to deliver and how they expected a student of my own caliber to maintain and use such information. I learnt new research methods and how I would be able to apply them in the future. The environment in the CMLL department was something that I appreciated very much. Being such a small group meant that you quickly got to know your peers and were able to communicate on a more personal level with your professors. To me, that was a fundamental aspect in my growth as a student. I thoroughly enjoyed working as the Social Affair VP on the Concordia Classics Student Association for my last year. I was able to co-organize and coordinate three wonderful social events with my other fellow members that allowed other students to find out what the program was about. CMLL has given me the opportunity to explore my ultimate dream. I am currently studying at Cambridge University in Great Britain, reading in Egyptology. Without the wonderful mentors, program fundamental and always supportive department, I would not be where I am today."</p>
