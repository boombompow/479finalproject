                <li>When the student has elected to obtain a full hearing under article 33, the execution of any decision of the Dean shall be suspended pending disposition by an Academic Hearing Panel.

            </ol>
            <p><span class="character-style-bold">Composition of the Academic Hearing Panels </span></p>
            <ol start="36">
                <li>An Academic Hearing Panel (&ldquo;AHP&rdquo;) of five (5) members, as well as a non-voting Chair, shall be selected by the Secretary for a given hearing. The AHP shall be composed of three (3) faculty members drawn from the Faculty Tribunal Pool and two (2) students drawn from the Student Tribunal Pool provided for under the <span class="character-style-italics">Policy on the Establishment of Tribunal Hearing Pools</span> (BD-6). Every attempt will be made to select at least one (1) faculty member and one (1) student from the student&rsquo;s constituency (i.e. by faculty and undergraduate or graduate status). </li>
                <li>In the absence of one or more panelists and with the consent of both parties, it shall be permitted to proceed with a reduced Panel. A reduced AHP shall be composed of the non-voting Chair as well as two (2) faculty members and one (1) student. </li>
            </ol>
            <p><span class="character-style-bold">Procedures Before an Academic Hearing Panel </span></p>
            <ol start="38">
                <li>Once a matter has been referred to the Secretary, he or she shall convene an AHP to hear the matter. Thereafter, the Secretary shall be responsible for all communications with the parties. </li>
                <li>A hearing shall be convened as soon as possible after the receipt by the Secretary of the notification and normally within fifteen (15) days. Once a hearing date is fixed by the Secretary, both parties shall submit any documentation they wish considered to the Secretary no later than ten (10) days before the scheduled hearing date. Such documentation shall include all supporting documents, including any submitted during the interview process, and a list of the witnesses, if any, that will appear. The Secretary shall transmit the documentation, together with a list of the Panel members selected for the case, to the parties no later than five (5) days before the scheduled hearing date. </li>
                <li>When not already evident from the case file, the Secretary shall inform the student of his or her right to consult any person and to be accompanied or represented by a student advocate from the Student Advocate Program, the CSU Student Advocacy Centre or any other member of the University community. </li>
                <li>Either party may object to the participation of a Panel member on the grounds of potential bias. A reasoned objection shall be filed with the Secretary in writing at least three (3) days prior to the hearing date. The Secretary shall arrange for an alternate Panel member to serve if he or she determines that the objection is well-founded. If the Secretary feels that the objection is frivolous and the matter cannot be resolved, the issue shall be forwarded to the Chair of the AHP who shall render a final decision in this regard. </li>
                <li>When the offence involves more than one student, either the students(s) or the Dean(s) may request that the Secretary schedule a joint hearing. If the request is initiated by the student(s), it shall be made at the time of his or her initial hearing request. A request from the Dean(s) shall be made following receipt of the student&rsquo;s hearing request notification. The consent of the other party and each of the students called upon to participate shall be obtained prior to proceeding with a Joint Hearing. The AHP has the discretion to uphold or dismiss the charge against each student and to apply the appropriate individual sanction. </li>
                <li>If a student wishes to withdraw his or her request for a hearing, normally the student shall notify the Secretary of the withdrawal at least seven (7) days prior to the hearing date. Following such a withdrawal, the Dean shall file a report with the Registrar, according to article 34, and include the information that the student withdrew his or her request for a hearing. </li>
            </ol>
            <p><span class="character-style-bold">The Hearing </span></p>
            <ol start="44">
                <li>The AHP shall establish its own rules of procedure. Minimally, these rules shall provide for opening statements by the parties, evidence and witnesses called by the parties (expert or otherwise), the right of cross-examination, questioning by members of the AHP, representations with respect to desired sanctions and closing statements. Hearings shall be recorded and the cassettes kept as part of the permanent record of the proceedings for a period of not less than five (5) years. </li>
                <li>The role of the Chair shall be to preside over the proceedings, keep order and ensure fairness. The Chair shall, as well, preside over the deliberations of the AHP but shall not vote. Decisions shall be by majority vote. The hearing shall be closed unless both parties have consented in writing to the attendance of members of the University community. </li>
                <li>The instructor in the course in which the offence took place, if applicable, may be present throughout the hearing or may be called as a witness by either of the parties. </li>
                <li>If the student fails to attend the hearing, the hearing may proceed in the student&rsquo;s absence or, at the Chair&rsquo;s discretion the start of the hearing may be postponed. If the hearing proceeds in the student&rsquo;s absence, all rights contingent on the student&rsquo;s presence, with the exception of the right to have an advocate present to plead for postponement, are forfeited. In such a case, a student&rsquo;s right of appeal is limited to a consideration of the reasonableness of his or her excuse for not appearing. If an Appeals Panel finds that the excuse is reasonable, it shall order a new hearing by a new AHP with the student present. The decision of the new hearing with the student present is appealable as if it were a first hearing. </li>
                <li>At a Hearing for a student charged with a repeat offence, other than the fact that a previous charge has been upheld and is, therefore, relevant in relation to article 52, any and all other information concerning the charge(s) shall be excluded, including the nature of the offence(s) and the sanction(s) imposed. </li>
                <li>The decision of the AHP shall be signed, dated and reasoned. The standard of proof to be relied upon by the AHP shall be one of &ldquo;a preponderance of evidence&rdquo;. A &ldquo;preponderance of evidence&rdquo; standard means that the Dean must establish that his or her version of the facts is significantly more probable. </li>
            </ol>
            <p><span class="character-style-bold">Sanctions</span> </p>
            <ol start="50">
                <li>Within ten (10) days from the conclusion of the hearing, the AHP shall write to the student and the Dean, with a copy to the Registrar, indicating its decision to dismiss the charge against the student or, in the case of upholding the charge, to impose one or more of the following sanctions: 
                    <ol>
                        <li class="loweralpha nospace">Reprimand the student; </li>

                        <li class="loweralpha nospace">Enter a failing grade for the course; </li>
                        <li class="loweralpha nospace">Enter a failing grade and ineligibility for a supplemental examination or any other evaluative exercise for the course; </li>
                        <li class="loweralpha nospace">Impose the obligation to take and pass courses of up to twenty-four (24) credits in addition to the total number of credits required for the student&rsquo;s program as specified by the Dean.

                <li>A sanction of suspension or expulsion is subject to confirmation by the Provost and Vice-President, Academic Affairs, who shall also determine the effective date. </li>
                <li>Any student found to have committed a second academic offence shall be expelled from the University subject to confirmation by the Provost and Vice-President, Academic Affairs. </li>
                <li>The decision of the AHP shall inform the parties of their right to seek an appeal from an Appeals Panel within fifteen (15) days after the date of transmission of the AHP decision. </li>
                <li>Where neither the Dean nor the student has sought an appeal from an Appeals Panel within the stipulated delay, the Secretary shall so inform the Registrar including a statement to the effect that the Dean and the student concerned were notified in writing of the action taken and of their right to seek an appeal from an Appeals Panel. Such report shall form a part of the student&rsquo;s permanent file maintained by the Registrar. This notification shall be sent to the Dean and the student. </li>
                <li>The execution of any sanctions by an AHP shall be suspended until the expiry of the delay to seek an appeal or until the rendering of the decision by an Appeals Panel if an appeal is heard. In such cases, the imposition of the sanction of a failing grade shall not be taken into account when calculating the student&rsquo;s grade point average. </li>

                <li>Should either the student or the Dean wish to seek an appeal from a decision or sanction of an AHP, he or she shall apply in writing to the Secretary for the authorization to seek an appeal within fifteen (15) days after the date of transmission of the AHP decision. An Appeals Panel shall decide whether an appeal shall be heard having regard to the circumstances of each case. </li>
                <li>Such request for authorization to appeal may be based only on the grounds of discovery of new evidence following the rendering of the decision of the AHP or on the presence of serious and prejudicial procedural defects of the AHP. The request shall state in clear and precise terms the grounds on which the appeal is based. The Appeals Panel shall be provided with the complete file of the AHP and its decision shall be based on the written record only. </li>

The Appeals Panel shall be composed of two (2) faculty members drawn from the Faculty Tribunal Pool and one (1) student drawn from the Student Tribunal Pool. <br />Every attempt will be made to select the student member from the student&rsquo;s constituency (undergraduate or graduate status). </li>
                <li>An Appeals Panel shall be convened as soon as possible after receipt of the authorization request by the Secretary and normally within fifteen (15) days. It shall normally render its decision with respect to the request within five (5) days of its consideration of the request. </li>
                <li>If the authorization to appeal is granted, the appeal shall normally be heard within fifteen (15) days of the decision to authorize the appeal. Notification of such shall be sent to both parties. </li>
                <li>The Appeals Panel has the authority to confirm, reverse or modify the decision being appealed. Further, should the appeal be based on the production of new evidence, the Appeals Panel may order a new hearing of the case by a new AHP. </li>

                <li>The decision of the Appeals Panel shall be final. </li>
                <li>In the case of the denial of an appeal where the sanction imposed by the AHP was suspension or expulsion, the suspension or expulsion shall take effect on a date to be determined by the Provost and Vice-President, Academic Affairs. </li>
