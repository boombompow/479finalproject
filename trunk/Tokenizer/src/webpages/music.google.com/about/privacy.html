<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Last modified: November 16, 2011
<p>The <a href="../../Documentswww.google.ca/intl/en/privacy/privacy-policy.html">Google Privacy
  Policy</a> describes how we treat personal information when you use Google's
products and services, including information provided when you use Google Music
Storage, the Google Music Store, the Google Music Software, Google Music Social
Recommendations, and the Google Music Artist Hub, each of which is defined in
the <a href="http://music.google.com/about/terms.html">Additional Terms of
Service for Google Music</a> ("Google Music Terms") and each is a Service as
defined in Section 1.1 of the <a href="../../Documentswww.google.ca/accounts/TOS">Google
Terms of Service</a>; all of these Services together are sometimes collectively
referred to here as the Service known as "Google Music."  Your usage of Google
Music on or through Android devices will also be governed by our
<a href="../../Documentswww.google.ca/intl/en/mobile/privacy.html">Mobile Privacy
Policy</a>, and your purchase history from the Google Music Store will also
governed by the <a href="https://checkout.google.com/files/privacy.html">Google
Wallet Privacy Policy</a>, except where expressly modified by this Google Music
Privacy Policy. In addition to the above, the following describes our additional
privacy practices specific to your use of all aspects of Google Music.
Capitalized terms not otherwise defined have the meanings given to them in the
Google Music Terms.
<h3 id="information">Personal Information</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Account information.</strong> Other than for browsing in
  the Google Music Store, you must have a Google Account that is linked to a
  Google Wallet Account to use Google Music, and because Google Music integrates
  access to your purchases and free content from the Google Music Store, your
  Google Music Social Recommendations, and with Your Music in Google Music
  Storage, you must use the same, identical Google Account for each component of
  Google Music, except for the Google Music Artist Hub.  If you use any
  component of the Google Music Services, you will become automatically enabled
  to use the other components as well (except for the Google Music Artist Hub)
  using the same log-in credentials and Google Account.  Google asks for some
  personal information when you create a Google Account, including your email
  address and password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorized
  access.  If you do not already have a Google Wallet account, you will be
  required to create one and provide and to provide credit card and personal
  billing information.  That billing information will be used to complete your
  purchases from the Google Music Store and, for security and geographical
  eligibility purposes, to verify your billing address.  Google's servers
  automatically record certain information about your use of Google Music.
  Similar to other web services, Google records information such as account
  activity (e.g., storage usage, number of log-ins, actions taken), data
  displayed or accessed, and other
  <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy/faq.html#toc-terms-server-logs">logs
  information</a> (e.g., browser or device type, IP address, date and time of
  access, cookie ID, and so forth).</li><br>
  <li><strong>Communications and Newsletters.</strong> In order to keep you
  informed about Google Music, we might send Service announcements and mandatory
  transactional information to the email address you provided when you
  registered for your Google Account.  We might also offer you the ability to
  opt in to receive additional information and promotional offers related to
  Google's digital music and entertainment offerings more generally (such as
  Google Music Magnifier or similar items) or offers and information from our
  content or promotional partners; in each instance, you will only receive this
  information if you opt in to receive it, and you can change your options in
  the settings for your Google Music Account.  You might also submit information
  to us when contacting us with a support question, and we might retain those
  emails or communications history for purpose of providing you with ongoing
  support or for purposes of internal training and product improvement.</li><br>
  <li><strong>Social Sharing.</strong> All information you share in public
  areas, such as through Google Music Social Recommendations, will be publicly
  visible to those who have access to your Google+ activity stream.  This
  information will include your name as you have chosen to display it in your
  Google+ Profile, information about the song or album you have chosen to share
  with your friends on Google+, and whatever written message or text you choose
  to share with your friends in conjunction with your Google Music Social
  Recommendation.</li><br>
  <li><strong>Content and usage information.</strong> Google Music stores,
  processes, and maintains information about your usage, access, and playback of
  Your Music in Google Music Storage ("Personal Usage"); about your purchase
  history and playback activity related to items you preview and buy in the
  Google Music Store ("Store Usage"); and about the songs you share and listen
  to in connection with Google Music Social Recommendations ("Social Usage")
  (all forms of usage history together, your "Usage Activity").  We may use your
  Usage Activity as a whole in order to provide and personalize the Service to
  you (e.g., to build Instant Mix playlists at your request, to make
  personalized recommendations for future purchases in the Google Music Store,
  etc.), and to improve Google's products and services.  Usage Activity may also
  include storage and analysis of information related to your use of the Service
  overall, playback counts, playlist content, and related information needed to
  provide you with personalized features of the Service. You can find more
  information about Instant Mix and personalized recommendations in the Google
  Music Help Center.  We might also share de-identified data (i.e., without any
  personally identifiable information attached) derived from or reflecting your
  Store Usage and Social Usage to our content partners for purposes of sales and
  financial audits, analysis of trends and usage patterns, and in connection
  with reports and payments of royalties to artists and copyright owners.  For
  purchases where we act as the content partner's agent, we include the state,
  city, and zip code from a purchaser's billing address in our de-identified
  transactions reports related to Store Usage.</li><br>
  <li><strong>Required Metadata from Record Labels</strong> Some purchases from
  the Google Music Store do not currently, but will in coming months, contain a
  unique identifier embedded in the metadata of digital download files that is
  required by some record labels of all companies that sell downloads of its
  music, known as "UITS" tags.  While Google does not currently attach this
  metadata to download files, it is retaining transaction information sufficient
  to insert that metadata for already made purchases retroactively when we do
  begin using the required UITS tags.  The metadata consists of a random number
  generated by Google using an algorithm to encrypt another algorithmically
  generated number that identifies the transaction for the purchase of that
  file, along with an identification of Google as the music store distributor
  and Google's digital signature, datestamp and/or timestamp of the purchase,
  and industry codes identifying the sound recording, and a digital indicator of
  whether the file has been modified.  <strong>Google does not insert any
  personally identifiable information into this metadata.</strong></li><br>
  <li><strong>Authorized Devices</strong> In order to authenticate your upload
  computers and/or authorized devices for offline access, to implement Service
  limitations as described in the
  <a href="http://music.google.com/about/terms.html">Google Music Terms</a>,
  and to enforce certain security limits related to contractual contractual
  commitments to content owners who license us music to sell, we may record
  device identifiers including your computer's MAC address or device identifiers
  such as IMEI or MEID for mobile devices.  You can delete a device identifier
  when you wish to stop using and de-register that device.</li>
 </ul>
<h3 id="uses">Uses</h3>
<p>We use your information to deliver the Service to you, to enforce usage
limitations in connection with the Service, to process and personalize your
requests in connection with your use of the Service, to provide non-personally
identifiable usage data, transaction data, and trends to our content partners,
to provide aggregate and/or de-identified usage data for copyright holders in
royalty reports, to develop new features, and to improve the overall quality of
Google's products and services.
<h3 id=choices">Your choices</h3>
<p>You may terminate your use of Google Music at any time by ceasing to use the
Services (or any individual Service, such as Google Music Storage, Google Music
Software, and so forth) and uninstalling any software related to the Service you
wish to terminate. You may also delete Content (including all or any portion of
Your Music or any purchased music from the Google Music Store) at any time and
the Content and any data directly attached to it (e.g., stored play counts) will
be deleted from our servers.  There may be some delay before any deletion is
reflected in our system.  Previously gathered Usage Activity may not be deleted
with your Content but can be deleted by terminating your Google Account;
however, you will not be able to delete the records of your purchase
transactions (including song or album purchased) from your Google Wallet account
history.  In addition, any information, statistics, and analysis derived from
any Usage Activity, including de-identified Usage Activity that has already been
shared with the parties and for the purposes listed above, will not be deleted
but will remain de-identified and unconnected with your personally identifiable
information.
