Trader Privacy Policy
</h1>

<p><b>April 30, 2009</b></p>

<p>
The
<a href="http://www.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a>
(www.google.com/privacy) describes how we treat personal information when you
use Google's products and services. In addition, the following describes our
privacy practices for information special to the Google Trader service.
</p>

<p><b>Information we collect</b></p>

<ul>
<li>When you use the service, we record any activity, such as viewing listings, searching listings and posting listings, and the time of that activity. For the website portion of the service, if you are not logged in, we do not know who you are, but you may only search and view listings. You need to log in if you wish to post or maintain your listings. If you log in, we will associate all your activity, including viewing and searching listings, with your account. For the SMS portion of the service, there is no log-in and all your activity is tied to your account. Your activity on the SMS portion of the service will be associated with an account tied to your phone number. Your activity on the website portion of the service, if you are logged in, will be tied to your Google Account. The phone number account and your Google Account are considered separate accounts and are not tied together.</li>
<li>If you post listings, we record the content of your posts (including any contact information you provide), the product category assigned to each posted listing, and the date and time of the post. If you post via SMS and do not add a contact phone number, we automatically append your phone number to the post. If you post via our website, we will not append any contact information to your posts, even if you forget to add any. However, if a user searches based on your Google Account, they will see your listings even though your Google Account is not shown in the listing itself.</li>
<li>For the SMS portion of the service, in addition to the phone number, we may collect other mobile information about your device, such as your device and hardware IDs and device type, the request type, your carrier, and your carrier user ID. This information does not by itself identify you to Google, though it may be unique or consist of or contain information that you consider personal.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Uses</b></p>

<ul>
<li>We use your information to process and personalize your requests. We also use the information for support, to develop new features, and to improve the overall quality of Google's products and services.</li>
<li>We may also use the information to show you a history of your activity, to provide you with statistics about you or your use of our product or service, or to provide you with a better user experience.</li>
<li>If you purchase something through Google, we may also use your information to handle billing or related disputes.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Information sharing and onward transfer</b></p>

<ul>
<li>All requests must be sent through your mobile carrier's network and your carrier may have access to it. For information regarding your carrier's treatment of your information, please consult your carrier's privacy policies.</li>
<li>We may share your information with certain third parties we use to perform
certain functions, such as  SMS delivery. These third parties will be
contractually bound to treat your information in accordance with the applicable
Google privacy policies.</li>
<li>All posts are publicly accessible, so please consider carefully before posting any personal information.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Your choices</b></p>

<ul>
<li>You can choose to delete your posts at any time, whether you use the SMS
portion of the service or the website portion of the service. There may be some
delay before any deletion is reflected in our system.</li>
</ul>
